# Bizzuu Game Project
## Objectives
Write a program that take a number and prints back each individual number, but with the following rules:
- if it is a multiple of 3 it returns 'BIZZ'
- if a multiple of 5 it return 'ZZUU'
- if a multiple of 3 and 5 it return 'BIZZUU'

## How to run the program
Run project_107_bizz_zzuu_run.py <br/>
The programme can be ran in two modes:
- **Run 1.** User input a number for one response from the program
- **Run 2.** User input a range and response speed for the program to play from 0 up to the range <br/>
    **By simply commenting out (#) the run type not in use to execute mode (Run 1.) or (Run 2.)*

## How to run the tests
Run project_107_bizz_zzuu_test.py
- T1 tests (function 1)
- T2 tests (function 2)
- T3 tests (function 3)
- T4 tests (function 4)

## How to access the functions or specifications
- **function 1. bizz_calc** validates multiples of 3
- **function 2. zzuu_calc** validates mulitples of 5
- **function 3. bizzuu_calc** using (functions 1. and 2.) to validate multiples of 3 and 5
- **function 4. bizzuu** final function used in run file to return final responses using (functions 1., 2. and 3.)
